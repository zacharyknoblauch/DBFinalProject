## Velvet Music Database

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **This is an ongoing personal project which I am still working on post-submission.**


This Project utilizes a SQLite database interfacing with a Flutter/Dart front end to create a music database.

The user can input a song, album, artist, and/or record label into the database, along with additional information such as release year, genre, etc. They can then link those entries together using foreign keys.

The user can search the database, opening a results screen that parses the return statement of the SQLite query. All database entries of each type are available for display on dedicated pages.

### TODO:

Integrate video player to display Youtube Videos.

Clean up search results screen to be easier to read.

Simplify search interface to make it more user friendly so the user doesn't need to understand query syntax to search the database.
